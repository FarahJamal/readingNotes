# Trees
***what is the trees?***

#### we have commonly termonolgy for trees:-


- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

#### Traversals

- An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

   - Depth First
     - Pre-order: root >> left >> right
     -  In-order: left >> root >> right
     -   Post-order: left >> right >> root

   - Breadth First
     - Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.


#### Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

- Trees can have any number of children per node
- but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).


#### K-ary Trees

```If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.```
